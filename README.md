## 🌐 Executive Summary
High employee turnover is a critical challenge for modern enterprises, leading to significant recruitment costs and loss of institutional knowledge. This project delivers a **Predictive Command Center** that transforms Human Resources from a reactive department into a data-driven strategic asset. 

Using a **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)**, the system analyzes 20+ variables—including compensation, work-life balance, and professional sentiment—to identify at-risk talent with high-precision confidence scores.

## 🚀 Key Modules

### 1. Executive Intelligence Dashboard
* **Workforce Overview:** Real-time visualization of attrition rates and organizational distribution.
* **Pay Equity Analytics:** Advanced box-plot analysis identifying the correlation between income levels and turnover.
* **Interactive Insights:** Built with **Plotly**, allowing stakeholders to explore department-specific trends dynamically.

### 2. Neural Risk Simulator
* **What-If Analysis:** HR Managers can adjust parameters (e.g., increasing salary or reducing overtime) to see the immediate impact on an employee's churn probability.
* **Retention Threat Index:** A calibrated radial gauge providing a 0-100% risk score based on the current AI model state.

### 3. Model Integrity & Transparency
* **Feature Importance Mapping:** A "Glassbox" AI approach that ranks the top drivers of attrition, ensuring HR strategies are based on data, not intuition.
* **Optimized Performance:** Built using 200 estimators with specific hyperparameter tuning to ensure reliability on imbalanced HR datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Engine:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
* **Interface:** Streamlit with Custom **Glassmorphism** CSS
* **Visuals:** Plotly Interactive Dashboards
* **Deployment:** CI/CD via GitHub & Streamlit Cloud

## 📊 Business Impact
* **Proactive Retention:** Identifying high-risk employees allows for early intervention and targeted retention strategies.
* **Cost Optimization:** Reducing turnover by even 5% can save a mid-sized firm hundreds of thousands in annual hiring costs.
* **Data-Driven Culture:** Provides managers with objective evidence to support policy changes regarding work-life balance and pay.
